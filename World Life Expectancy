📌 Project Overview
The World Life Expectancy project is an SQL-based analysis exploring global trends in life expectancy. Divided into two key phases—Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)—it highlights how SQL can deliver valuable insights into global health.

🧹 Phase 1: Data Cleaning
This stage transformed raw, inconsistent data into a structured dataset. The original data included country, year, development status, GDP, population, and life expectancy, but had missing values and duplicates.

🔧 Key Steps:

Initial Audit: Checked structure and nulls in GDP, population, and life expectancy.

Missing Values: Replaced with country- and status-specific averages using AVG() and ROUND().

Duplicates: Removed using ROW_NUMBER() with PARTITION BY.

Data Types: Cast fields properly as FLOAT or INT.

Validation: Ensured completeness and reviewed distributions.

✅ Result: A cleaned dataset of 2,938 reliable records, ready for analysis.

📊 Phase 2: EDA
With clean data, the focus shifted to life expectancy trends.

🔍 Key Insights:

Top & Bottom Countries: Japan ranked highest; Sierra Leone among the lowest (GROUP BY, ORDER BY).

Development Status: Developed nations averaged 78 years vs. 64 for developing ones.

GDP Correlation: Weak-to-moderate positive link with life expectancy.

Population Impact: No strong correlation, but large nations improved over time.

Yearly Trends: Life expectancy rose steadily from 2000 to 2015.

Annual Performers: Used RANK() to highlight yearly leaders and laggards.

🧰 Tools & Techniques:
SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL), AVG(), ROUND(), ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), CASE, CTEs, window functions.

💡 Learnings:

Clean data is essential for trustworthy analysis.

SQL is a strong tool for EDA.

Localized imputation improves data reliability.

🎯 Outcome:
A refined dataset and valuable insights into how GDP, development, and population relate to global health—showcasing SQL’s power in data cleaning and analysis.
