This project involved the end-to-end preparation and exploratory analysis of a large US income dataset using SQL. 
The goal was to extract insights into income distribution across demographics such as age, gender, education, and employment type.

I started with a comprehensive data cleaning process, resolving missing values, standardising inconsistent labels, and removing duplicates. 
This involved creating temporary tables, updating incorrect entries, and using CASE, TRIM, and other SQL functions to ensure data integrity.

Once cleaned, I moved on to the exploratory data analysis (EDA) stage. Key analyses included:

Identifying income trends by age group and education level

Comparing income levels across genders and ethnicities

Evaluating the relationship between workclass and income

Summarising categorical variables with GROUP BY, COUNT, and AVG functions

Visualising income brackets using simple aggregated queries

The project strengthened my SQL skills in joins, subqueries, data transformation, and the application of analytical logic in structured datasets. 
It also reinforced best practices in data wrangling, normalisation, and reproducible SQL scripting.

Tools used: MySQL, DB Browser for SQLite
Key skills: Data Cleaning, SQL Querying, EDA, Data Validation, Schema Understanding

This project not only showcased my technical proficiency with SQL but also my ability to draw meaningful insights from raw, 
messy dataâ€”making it suitable for decision-making or further modelling in data science pipelines.
